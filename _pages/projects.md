Here is a collection of final projects and reports from my graduate and undergraduate coursework.

## Physics
* **[3D Point-Mass Gravity: No Horizon and Conical Singularity](/files/gr_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* General Relativity
  * *Description:* Derived the spherically symmetric point-mass solution in 2+1D Einstein gravity, showing that spacetime is locally flat with a conical singularity instead of an event horizon. Analyzed geodesic motion in this background to obtain the acceleration of a test particle.*
 
* **[Introduction to marginal triviality of the scaling limits of critical 4D Ising and $\phi^4$ models](/files/qft_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Quantum Field Theory (II)
  * *Decsription:* This report provides a brief summary and overview of Aizenman and Duminil-Copin’s work on the triviality of 4D Ising and $\phi^4$ models. It focuses on the key techniques used in the proof, such as the Griffiths-Simon class and the random current representation, to analyze correlation functions and enable us to connect two theory, and enable us to analyze on one side to solve the problem in the other side.*
     
## Mathematics
* **[Morse Theory and Bott Periodicity Theorem](/files/geometry_final.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Geometry (Honored Course)
  * *Description:* Established the link between critical points and manifold homotopy types and applied these concepts to Riemannian geometry to derive the Morse Index Theorem. Analyzed the space of minimal geodesics in $SU(2m)$ to provide a geometric proof of the Bott Periodicity Theorem for the unitary group.*
 
* **[Variational Methods for Non-linear PDEs in Mathematical Physics](/files/physequation_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Equations of Mathematical Physics (Ⅰ) 
  * *Description:* This project analyzed existence theories for non-linear PDEs based on Michael Struwe’s Variational Methods, covering both Direct Methods and Minimax Methods. I utilized advanced functional analysis tools, such as the Concentration Compactness Principle and the Mountain Pass Lemma, to rigorously establish the existence of minimizers and saddle points in variational problems.*
