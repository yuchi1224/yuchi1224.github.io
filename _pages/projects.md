Here is a collection of final projects and reports from my graduate and undergraduate coursework.

## Physics
* **[3D Point-Mass Gravity: No Horizon and Conical Singularity](/files/gr_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* General Relativity
  * *Description:* Derived the spherically symmetric point-mass solution in 2+1D Einstein gravity, showing that spacetime is locally flat with a conical singularity instead of an event horizon. Analyzed geodesic motion in this background to obtain the acceleration of a test particle.*
 
* **[Introduction to marginal triviality of the scaling limits of critical 4D Ising and $\phi^4$ models](/files/qft_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Quantum Field Theory (II)
  * *Decsription*: A general review of the mathematical proof showing that 4D quantum fields become Gaussian in the scaling limit. The discussion highlights the paper's special techniques, specifically how the random current representation is used to resolve the marginal dimension problem.*
     
## Mathematics
* **[Morse Theory and Bott Periodicity Theorem](/files/geometry_final.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Geometry (Honored Course)
  * *Description:* Established the link between critical points and manifold homotopy types and applied these concepts to Riemannian geometry to derive the Morse Index Theorem. Analyzed the space of minimal geodesics in $SU(2m)$ to provide a geometric proof of the Bott Periodicity Theorem for the unitary group.
