Here is a collection of final projects and reports from my graduate and undergraduate coursework.

## Physics
* **[3D Point-Mass Gravity: No Horizon and Conical Singularity](/files/gr_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* General Relativity
  * *Description:* Derived the spherically symmetric point-mass solution in 2+1D Einstein gravity, showing that spacetime is locally flat with a conical singularity instead of an event horizon. Analyzed geodesic motion in this background to obtain the acceleration of a test particle.
 
* **[Introduction to marginal triviality of the scaling limits of critical 4D Ising and $\phi^4$ models](/files/qft_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Quantum Field Theory (II)
  * *Decsription:* This report provides a brief summary and overview of Aizenman and Duminil-Copin’s work on the triviality of 4D Ising and $\phi^4$ models. It focuses on using the Griffiths-Simon class to bridge $\phi^4$ theory with the Ising model, effectively translating the problem into a statistical mechanics framework.
     
## Mathematics
* **[Morse Theory and Bott Periodicity Theorem](/files/geometry_final.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Geometry (Honored Course)
  * *Description:* Established the link between critical points and manifold homotopy types and applied these concepts to Riemannian geometry to derive the Morse Index Theorem. Analyzed the space of minimal geodesics in $SU(2m)$ to provide a geometric proof of the Bott Periodicity Theorem for the unitary group.
 
* **[Variational Methods for Non-linear PDEs in Mathematical Physics](/files/physequation_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Equations of Mathematical Physics (Ⅰ) 
  * *Description:* This project analyzed existence theories for non-linear PDEs based on Michael Struwe’s Variational Methods, covering both Direct Methods and Minimax Methods. I utilized advanced functional analysis tools, such as the Concentration Compactness Principle and the Mountain Pass Lemma, to rigorously establish the existence of minimizers and saddle points in variational problems.
