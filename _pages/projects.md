Here is a collection of final projects and reports from my graduate and undergraduate coursework.

## Physics
* **[3D Point-Mass Gravity: No Horizon and Conical Singularity](/files/gr_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* General Relativity
  * *Description:* Derived the spherically symmetric point-mass solution in 2+1D Einstein gravity, showing that spacetime is locally flat with a conical singularity instead of an event horizon. Analyzed geodesic motion in this background to obtain the acceleration of a test particle.


## Mathematics
* **[Morse Theory and Bott Periodicity Theorem](/files/geometry_project.pdf)**
  * *Course:* Geometry (Honored Course)
  * *Description:* Established the link between critical points and manifold homotopy types and applied these concepts to Riemannian geometry to derive the **Morse Index Theorem**. Analyzed the space of minimal geodesics in $SU(2m)$ to provide a geometric proof of the **Bott Periodicity Theorem** for the unitary group.
