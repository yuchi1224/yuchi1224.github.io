I enjoy organizing my understanding of physics and mathematics into rigorous notes. Below are some of the lecture notes I have written.

## Research Notes
* **Notes about Hidden Zeros and Surfaceology**
  * [Hidden Zeros in Stringy Amplitude of $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ Theory and ABHY Associahedron](/files/hidden1.pdf)
  * [Stringy Deformation: Relation between $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ Theory, NLSM, and YM theory](/files/hidden2.pdf)
* **Notes about Scaffolding Techniques and Zeros in Open String Amplitudes**
  *[] 
   
* **[String Theory I](/files/string_notes.pdf)**
  * Based on Polchinski's book, covering bosonic string quantization.

## Undergraduate Mathematics
* **[Complex Analysis](/files/complex_notes.pdf)**
  * Notes on contour integration and residue theorem.
