I enjoy organizing my understanding of physics and mathematics into rigorous notes. Below are some of the lecture notes I have written.

## Graduate Physics
* **[Advanced Quantum Mechanics](/files/aqm_notes.pdf)**
  * Comprehensive notes covering scattering theory and identical particles.
  
* **[String Theory I](/files/string_notes.pdf)**
  * Based on Polchinski's book, covering bosonic string quantization.

## Undergraduate Mathematics
* **[Complex Analysis](/files/complex_notes.pdf)**
  * Notes on contour integration and residue theorem.
