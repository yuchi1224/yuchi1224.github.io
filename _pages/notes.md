I enjoy organizing my understanding of physics and mathematics into rigorous notes. Below are some of the lecture notes I have written.

## Research Notes
* **Notes about Hidden Zeros and Surfaceology**
  * [Hidden Zeros in Stringy Amplitude of $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ Theory and ABHY Associahedron](/files/hidden1.pdf)
  * [Stringy Deformation: Relation between $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ Theory, NLSM, and YM theory](/files/hidden2.pdf)
* **Notes about Scaffolding Techniques and Zeros in Open String Amplitudes**
  * [Scaffolding preserve Primary](/files/opeprimary.pdf)
  * [Relation between u-variables and F-polynomials](/files/uvarparametrization.pdf)
  * [Properties of u-variables and F-polynomials and Zeros in Tachyon](/files/relationandzeros.pdf)
  * [Dirty Calculation of Explicit Example](/files/Dirty.pdf)

## Undergraduate Mathematics
* **[Complex Analysis](/files/complex_notes.pdf)**
  * Notes on contour integration and residue theorem.
