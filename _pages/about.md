I am a master's graduate in Physics from **National Taiwan University (NTU)**, where I also completed a BS in **Physics and Mathematics**.

My research lies at the interface of **High Energy Theory** and **Mathematical Physics**. I am particularly interested in using rigorous mathematical structures—such as **Tropical Geometry**, **Complex Geometry**, and **Integrability**—to uncover hidden properties in **Scattering Amplitudes** and **String Theory**.

I was advised by [Prof. Yu-Tin Huang](https://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/~yutin/) at NTU. My recent work focuses on developing scaffolding techniques to construct string amplitudes and identifying their hidden zeros, as detailed in my paper *"[All zeros of (super) String Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15299)"*.

I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Physics (Fall 2026 entry), aiming to further explore the geometric and algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory and gravity.

You can find my [CV here](/cv/) and a list of my [publications here](/publications/).

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
